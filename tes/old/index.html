          <p class="text-center" style="padding:30px;"><strong>For over 30 years, until recently, the Pete Newell Big Man Camp in the USA was the place where hundreds of NBA and college big men were helped to develop a stronger inside game. But the cost of the camp (1.750 € for 18 hours of coaching) and its location (Hawaii) made it far too expensive for European players. RICK MAHORN BIG MAN CAMP brings this very type of experience to Europe at an affordable cost.<strong></p>

							<p class="lead">Rick Mahorn was a member of the legendary Detroit Pistons “Bad Boys,” a veteran of 18 season in the NBA as well as two seasons in Italy. Rick is currently the radio voice of the Pistons.</p>
							<p>“My goal will be to get you to always be a student of the game. Hakeem was one of the most gifted post players, but guys like Kareem and Kevin McHale, once they developed a counter-move became much harder to defend. You will leave the camp with a better understanding of the game, and of YOUR game that will help you become the best player you can be. Based on my many years as a player and coach, I would say that the MENTAL part of the game is holding far too many players back today. Combine the mental aspect with the physical skills and you will become a more complete player. THIS COMBINATION MAKES OUR CAMP THE MOST UNIQUE CAMP IN THE WORLD.”.</p>

									<p>“The Rick Mahorn Big Man Camp was an amazing experience for me. Working with Rick was such a great opportunity. He really cared so much about all the players in the camp and wanted to help each of us to become a better player. It truly felt like a father-son relationship. I benefitted so much from this, and also from having Mitch Smith helping us with the mental game. He helped me to understand how to better prepare for a game and to understand how to stay confident.</p>
                  <p>I highly recommend this camp to any player who wants to play in the USA, or any professional player who wants to take his game to a higher level. You will work with one of the best post players in NBA history as well as an excellent sport psychologist who has worked with hundreds of big man in the USA and Europe. This is truly a camp that will make a difference in your game and your career. It helped me prepare for the 2014-15 season and enabled me to play my best basketball.”</p>

									<p>“My brother Yogev (206 cm) and myself (217 cm) both attended the 2014 Rick Mahorn Big Man Camp and we both found it essential to ourselves as big men. Our daily practices at home are not always adapted to our size and role as big men. To have a former NBA player like Rick teach us from his great experience was a great opportunity, one that we were very lucky to have. The unique exercises and moves that he taught us were very helpful and we continue to practice them during our training throughout the year and they definitely helped us to improve our game.</p>

                  <p>In addition, we received many great cognitive tools from Mitch Smith that have proven so useful in helping us to overcome the mental obstacles which we have had in practices and in games. Both of us have found that our coaches do not typically pay attention to the special needs of the big man – they know we are different from other players and that we need to be coached differently, but not every coach knows how to train big men successfully. We found the Rick Mahorn Big Man Camp to be very focused for tall players and we got things that we haven’t found anywhere else.”</p>
